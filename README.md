# CRYPTOSETGANOGRAPHY

This project is based on the use of cryptography and steganography for data security.

In this project, Hybrid Cryptosystem (El-Gamal and Blowfish) is used to encrypt secret document (in .docx, .pptx, or .xlsx format) to generate CipherText. The CipherText the pass through a Text Steganography process to generate a secured document called Stego.

The Stego can be generated in .docx, .pptx, .xlsx and/or .pdf format.

For every secure process, a secret file and cover file is required.

For every retriev process, a stego file and cover file is required.

Sample of test file is available in the testdata folder of this repository.
